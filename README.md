## KinematicsTests
This is a simple, 2D, 2 Bone Inverse Kinematics demo that based on example code by Ryan Juckett (see credits.)

### Requirements
KinematicsTests requires the Java 8 JRE, or later.  There is a [**Runnable JAR file**](https://github.com/wholder/KinematicsTests/tree/master/out/artifacts/KinematicsTests_jar) included in the checked in code that you can download.   On a Mac, just double click the `KinematicsTests.jar` file and it should start.  Or, the first time you run the progam, you may have to select the `KinematicsTests.jar` file, then do a right click and select "Open" to satisfy Mac OS' security checks._  You should also be able to run the JAR file on Windows or Linux systems, but you'll need to have a Java 8 JRE, or later installed and follow the appropriate process for each needed to run an executable JAR file.
